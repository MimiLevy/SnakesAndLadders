# Snakes & Ladders

## Overview
This repo is for the software implementation of the well-known classic game of Snakes & Ladders,  
This game will allow two players to play against each other in a fun computer game.

## The Game
2 players play on a board with 100 squares numbered from 1 to 100.   
Each player in turn throws the dice and marches his pawn a number of steps according to the 
number he received.  
If the last step encounters the bottom of a ladder, the player will take his pawn and 
go up to the top of the ladder   
and the next turn will continue from there.   
If the last move encounters a snake's head, the player will slide the pawn to where 
the snake's tail is,   
and on the next turn continue from there.   
The winner is the one who brings his pawn to the end point first! 

**The full spec for the game is in the repo, check out the docs folder.**
